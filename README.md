# Mastering TensorFlow

TensorFlow is probably the most important framework when talking about deep learning. This repo contains my baby steps towards mastering such a framework entirely!

First things first, I am turning basic, starting off with two books. LET'S GO! **in Robert Frank's voice**

- **Practical  Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs* by Ahmed Fawzy Gad - Chapter 6 "TensorFlow Recognition Application". 
- **Pro Deep Learning with TensorFlow* (A Mathematical Approach to Advanced Artificial Intelligence in Python) by Santanu Pattanayak.
